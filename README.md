<h1>Chapter 1 - Clean Code</h1>
</a>

#### You are here for two reasons

- You are a programmer
- You want to be a better programmer

#### By end of this read,

- You'll be able to differentiate between good code and bad code
- You'll know how to write good code
- You'll know how to transform bad code into good code.

### Why write bad code?

- Trying to go fast?
- Overwhelmed by looking at the backlog?
- Deadlines?

Above could be few of the reasons for writing bad code.

<b>Never</b> think that you would revisit  your code and clean it later which is never possible, as stated below

[LeBlanc's law](http://on-agile.blogspot.com/2007/04/why-you-wont-fix-it-later.html) "Later Equals Never" 

### Why does code rot so quickly into bad code?

- Developers always complain that the requirements changed in ways that prevent from accomplishing original design
- Developers express discontent over schedules that were too tight.
- Developers always complain about managers, customers.

> It's the responsibility of developers to help work out the schedule. Developers are responsible in clearly communicating
> the way we think and project managers look to us to help work out the schedule.

It's not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time.
